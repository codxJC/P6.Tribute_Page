#### PROJECT SCOPE

This is the freeCodeCamp project *"Build a Tribute Page"* - 
which had to meet specific requirements. 
I also made the webpage responsive as an extra exercise, which was not part of the project.

The two first rulesets of code I added to my CSS is something I used for the first time
and simplified my code significantly.

Reading the book "CSS in Depth" by Keith Grant has helped so much to understand CSS better <br> and learned so many tricks - this book is a keeper.
