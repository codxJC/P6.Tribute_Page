        <h3>The timeline of his life</h3>
        <div id="tribute-info">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1883</strong> - Born in Kymi, Greece.</li>
                <li><strong>1898</strong> - At the age of 15, Papanikolaou attended the University of Athens Medical
                    School.</li>
                <li><strong>1904</strong> - Received his medical degree from the University of Athens.</li>
                <li><strong>1906</strong> - After serving in the Armed Forces he returned to Kymi where he practiced
                    medicine with his father.</li>
                <li><strong>1907</strong> - Studied at the University of Jena in Germany</li>
                <li><strong>1910</strong> - Graduated with a Phd in zoology from the University of Munich. Married his wife Andromachi Mary Papanikolaou in Athens.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1913</strong> - Immigrated to New York with his wife to work in the department of Pathology
                    of New York Hospital and the Department of Anatomy at the Cornell Medical College of Cornell
                    University.</li>
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Papanikolaou and his wife worked at the Department of Anatomy at the Cornell
                    Medical College of Cornell University and contributed to the histological and physiological changes
                    associated with the oestrus cycle in the guinea pig.</li>
                <li><strong>1917</strong> - Papanikolaou along with Charles R. Stockard demonstrated that, in the guinea
                    pig, the histologic cyclic changes that occur in the reproductive tract during the estrus cycle also
                    occur in the vaginal mucosa and can be detected by cytologic examination of vaginal smears.This
                    technique (termed the Papanikolaou technique) was groundbreaking and also facilitated the discovery
                    of an ovarian hormone. Papanikolaou later began examining the human reproductive system. </li>
                <li><strong>1920</strong> - He realized that he could tell the difference between normal and malignant
                    cells on the cervix by viewing smears on a slide under a microscope.</li>
                <li><strong>1925</strong> - With funds from the National Research Council and the Maternal Health
                    Committee, Papanikolaou recruited 12 hospital staff volunteers, together with a number of pregnant
                    gynecological and surgical patients, for a systematic study of cervical cell morphology.</li>
                <li><strong>1928</strong> - He first reported that uterine cancer could be diagnosed by means of a
                    vaginal smear, but the importance of his work was not recognized until 1943.</li>
                <li><strong>1950</strong> - He received the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research (the
                    American equivalent to the Nobel Prize in Physiology). Papanikolaou received many prestigious prizes
                    and awards for his discoveries. </li>
                <li><strong>1954</strong> - He published he Atlas of Exfoliative Cytology, thus creating the foundation
                    of the modern medical specialty of Cytopathology. </li>
                <li><strong>1961</strong> - He moved to Miami, Florida, to develop the Papanikolaou Cancer Research
                    Institute at the University of Miami.</li>
                <li><strong>1962</strong> - Died due to a myocardial infarction at the age of 78. His wife continued his work until her death in 1982.</li>

        <h3>Other facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Pap smear test (AE) / cervical smear (BE), remains an effective, widely used method for early detection
                of precancer and cervical cancer and is used all over the world.</li>
            <li>By some accounts, the Pap test is considered the most significant advance in the control of cancer in
                the 20th century.</li>
            <li>The Pap Smear Test is saving lives! Women owe also to Andromachi Mary Papanikolaou, his wife, who became his
                laboratory assistant and research subject. For 21 years, Mary Papanikolaou volunteered as an
                experimental subject for her husband, climbing up onto his examination couch every day so that he could
                sample and smear her cervix.
